    head and tail are global pointers to the first and last element, respectively, of a
singly-linked list of integers. Implement C functions for the following prototypes:
bool remove( Element *elem );
bool insertAfter( Element *elem, int data );
The argument to remove is the element to be deleted. The two arguments to
insertAfter give the data for the new element and the element after which the
new element is to be inserted. It should be possible to insert at the beginning of the
list by calling insertAfter with NULL as the element argument. These functions
should return true if successful and false if unsuccessful.
Your functions must keep the head and tail pointers current.

    /*
    Given a singly-linked list, devise a time- and space-efficient algorithm to find the
mth-to-last element of the list. Implement your algorithm, taking care to handle relevant
error conditions. Define mth to last such that when m = 0, the last element of
the list is returned.
